# Notebook

A Notebook is an environment with which you can create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and text, commonly referred to as the **computational documents**.

It offers a simple, streamlined, document-centric experience. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning. A modular design invites extensions to expand and enrich functionality.

## Jupyter

Notebooks were made famous by project Jupyter, so much so, that they were referred to as Jupyter Notebooks.

The Jupyter is an acronym, where **Ju** stands for [Julia](https://julialang.org/), **Pyt** stands for [Python](https://www.python.org/) and **r** stands for the [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) programming language.

### Highlights

 - **Language of choice** - kernels are available for **over 40 languages**
 - **Sharing** - Notebooks can be shared with others using email, Dropbox, GitHub and the [Jupyter Notebook Viewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)
 - **Interactive output** - Your code can produce rich, interactive output: HTML, images, videos, LaTeX, and custom MIME types

## DotNet Interactive (or Polyglot Notebooks)

[DotNet Interactive](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive) combines the power of .NET with many other languages to create notebooks, REPLs, and embedded coding experiences. Today .NET Interactive is an engine capable of running multiple languages. It also supports full language server support and variable sharing for the following languages:

    C#
    F#
    PowerShell
    JavaScript
    SQL
    KQL (Kusto Query Language)
    HTML*
    Mermaid*

*Variable sharing not available

There is a VS Code extension to support notebooks called Polyglot Notebooks (for DotNet and other languages; which was earlier called the .NET Interactive Notebooks).
