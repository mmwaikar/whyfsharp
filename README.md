# Why F#

Notebooks explaining why one should use F#.

F# is a modern functional first, mixed FP-OO language from the ML family.

## Static vs. Dynamic

F# completely *side steps* the static vs. dynamic debate and is at the **golden middle sweet-spot**. The compiler is strong enough to `infer types` in most cases, so write your code in a dynamic fashion to your heart's content, but if you want intellisense and other advantages, specify types only for the things (parameters) you need, **or** when the compiler can't infer types for you.

# A brief summary

If you want a brief summary for why to use F#, please refer to the [F# for the Office?](https://jkone27-3876.medium.com/f-for-the-office-a5077e04e234) article, and for a detailed look, refer to the notebooks in this repository.
