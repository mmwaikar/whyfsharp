    "- It should have a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-eval-print_loop) called Read-Eval-Print-Loop. A REPL is an interactive text-based interface for incrementally creating a program, providing it with input, and seeing its output. While historically one usually interacts with a REPL through a terminal, there are also a number of GUI-based REPLs e.g. a Notebook is just a visual REPL. **And, it should be possible for me to experiment with third party libraries in a REPL.**\n",
